## Amazon Web Services Legacy Components for BuildMaster

This extension contains the legacy components (legacy plan actions, etc.) for use in BuildMaster v6.0 and later that was formerly named the Amazon extension.

New v6.0+ installations or any installations that do not use any [legacy features](https://inedo.com/support/kb/1144/buildmaster-legacy-features) should not install this extension.

Future development of Amazon Web Services integrations will be added to the [AWS](https://github.com/inedo/inedox-aws) extension.
